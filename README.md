# Q3A-RandRote
Quake 3 Arena Random Map Rotator

Two best friends were so young at the turn of the century, and so nerdy, playing their Q3A instead of getting laid.

20 years later, busy in their now post-laid, with actual-wives-and-children lives (üéäüëç), they are separated by a continent, but alas, they have indeed noticed that Internet connections are so much faster now.  They could probably even setup a Q3A server somehwere in the middle of the country and both get reasonable pings?  Yes, they can!  Some of that dot-com dark fiber really _is_ glowing!

The fragging has picked up right where it left off.  But how about randomizing that damn map rotation!?

It was supposed to be a really basic bash script... then I realized I wanted an option to have a specific map always be one of the first 3 in the rotation, which then created a bunch of logic requirements.  It was at halfway through writing that logic  when I realized I probably should've written this in Python, but who really gives a shit.


# Instructions
1. List your favorite map names in a file called `mappool`
2. Set your baseq3 path in the script
3. Run this script with an arg for the number of maps you want to randomly rotate
	ex: `randrote.sh 5`
4. Run your dedicated quake3 server with `+exec maplist.cfg`
	ex: `ioq3ded +exec maplist.cfg`
5. Have so much fun fragging, ok? ‚ù§Ô∏è

TIP: Put this in a nightly cronjob!
